## Description

The aim of this project is to build our own search engine. First we will implement the text processing algorithms, then the indexing process, next the ranking method, and finally a UI together with analytics.

## How to execute

The code is implemented in Jupyter notebooks for better readibility and visualization of the ouputs.

To execute locally, clone this repository and run locally on Jupyter.

To execute in Google Colab, clone using the built-in GitHub feature on Colab, or upload the root folder to Google Drive. When running the notebook, make sure to uncomment the second cell where the `google.colab` library is imported and the project's root folder is mounted.
